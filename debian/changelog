polyglot (1.4.67b) unstable; urgency=low
	
  *   Disable "book learning". Polyglot saves learning information but does not use it itself, probably for a reason. I believe the booklearning concept of Polyglot is fundamentally broken. Learning information is engine specific so it should not be saved in the opening book (it might be saved elsewhere). There are other issues as well, such as copyright and the possibility of the proliferation of polluted books. Opening books can be improved with information from games by using the merge command. This is a form of off line learning which is probably much more effective since one has strict control over what kind of information is added to the book.

polyglot (1.4.65b) unstable; urgency=low

polyglot (1.4.64b) unstable; urgency=low
	
  *   Reduce movetime in the implementation of the fixed time per move command (st), to account for differences in the wording of the protocols. 
	
 -- Michel Van den Bergh <michel.vandenbergh@uhasselt.be>  Fri, 31 Dec 2010 21:00:00 +0100	

polyglot (1.4.63b) unstable; urgency=low

polyglot (1.4.62b) unstable; urgency=low
	
  *  StringSize was not everywhere the same in Polyglot. This could lead to a buffer overflow in case of very long PV's.

polyglot (1.4.59b) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugfix: the changes in 1.4.57b created a regression where the input buffer of polyglot could overflow with engines producing lots of output very fast. 

 -- Michel Van den Bergh <michel.vandenbergh@uhasselt.be>  Wed, 29 Sep 2010 21:00:00 +0100
	
polyglot (1.4.58b) unstable; urgency=low

polyglot (1.4.50b) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change in architecture. Persistence is disabled. The user is required to push th "Save" button explicitly to save the settings. What is retained is that in case PG is invoked with -noini (or as a special exception for WB 4.4.0 when the config files are polyglot_1st.ini or polyglot_2nd.ini) then PG uses a default config file whose name is derived from the engine name. 

  * New option: OnlyWbOptions (default: true). Restrict the options that PG sends to those that are potentially useful for WinBoard.

 -- Michel Van den Bergh <michel.vandenbergh@uhasselt.be>  Fri, 9 Sep 2009 21:00:00 +0100
	
polyglot (1.4.46b) unstable; urgency=low

  * The default persistence directory on Windows is now _PG. The names of the engine specific ini files are mangled so as not to contain spaces. 
	
  * PG now tries to guess if a string option is really a file or a path (like in the Arena GUI). 
	
 -- Michel Van den Bergh <michel.vandenbergh@uhasselt.be>  Fri, 4 Sep 2009 21:00:00 +0100

polyglot (1.4.45b) unstable; urgency=low

  * The engine specific config files (<myname>.ini) are now stored in a separate directory. $HOME/.polyglot on Linux and "./Polyglot Settings" on Windows. 
	
  * The engine specific config files are now complete config files. So they can be used in a stand alone fashion.

  * Implemented a minor hack to make xboard show error messages during startup.
	
 -- Michel Van den Bergh <michel.vandenbergh@uhasselt.be>  Fri, 4 Sep 2009 21:00:00 +0100

polyglot (1.4.44b) unstable; urgency=low

  * "Implementation" of new buttons and controls.
	
  * The "Persist" option is now persistent. That is if you turn of "Persist" then as a special case PG will remember this.
	
  * There is now a "reset" button which restores the default options. The code is commented out since WB does not support it yet.
	
 -- Michel Van den Bergh <michel.vandenbergh@uhasselt.be>  Thu, 3 Sep 2009 21:00:00 +0100

polyglot (1.4.42b) unstable; urgency=low

  * SaveSettingsOnExit/SaveFile renamed as Persist/PersistFile.
	
  * Many bug fixes in the persistence feature.
	
  * The PG_<myname>.ini file now contains only options that have been changed. So the resulting ini files are much smaller. This makes this version of PG usable on WB 4.3.15 as now the engine specific ini file will be empty (the user has no way to change options).	
	
 -- Michel Van den Bergh <michel.vandenbergh@uhasselt.be>  Mon, 1 Sep 2009 21:00:00 +0100

polyglot (1.4.41b) unstable; urgency=low
	
  * Some segfaults fixed in case of corrupt config files.
	
  * Persistence of options. If the option SaveSettingsOnExit is true (the default) PolyGlot now saves its options in a file whose name is given by the option SaveFile which by default is equal to the engine name, prefixed by PG_ suffixed by ".ini".

polyglot (1.4.39b) unstable; urgency=low
	
  * Refactoring of config file parsing

  * Fix crash bug in epd-test
	
  * Do not export Chess960. This is handled completely internally. 
	
  * Do not export UCI_Opponent and UCI_Chess960. These are handled internally.
	
  * PG can now also be comfortably configured through command line options (i.e. without using a config file). 
	
  * Allow quotes in configfile (as in Fonzy Bleumer's PG). 
	
 -- Michel Van den Bergh <michel.vandenbergh@uhasselt.be>  Sun, 23 Aug 2009 21:00:00 +0100

polyglot (1.4.37b) unstable; urgency=low

  * Two new options: BookDepth and BookTreshold. BookDepth limits the number of moves the book is used and BookTreshold sets the minimum weight a book move should have.
	
 -- Michel Van den Bergh <michel.vandenbergh@uhasselt.be>  Fri, 12 Aug 2009 21:00:00 +0100

polyglot (1.4.36b) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugfix: option = 0/1 was translated incorrectly.

  * EOF received from the engine should now be logged correctly (i.e. after the buffer is empty)

  * Bugfix: Nasty buffer overflow in the macro CONSTRUCT_ARG_STRING.

  * Bugfix: pipex_writeln (win32) was logging at the wrong spot. 

  * Log board when an illegal move is received.
	
 -- Michel Van den Bergh <michel.vandenbergh@uhasselt.be>  Tue, 11 Aug 2009 21:00:00 +0100

polyglot (1.4.35b) unstable; urgency=low

  * New WbWorkAround for silly bug in WB. Depth <=1 clears the engine output window. Why shouldn't an engine be allowed to send info at depth one?	

 -- Michel Van den Bergh <michel.vandenbergh@uhasselt.be>  Thu, 7 Aug 2009 20:00:00 +0100

polyglot (1.4.34b) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow spaces around "=" in "option =" commands.
	
  * WbWorkArounds is now true by default.
	
  * Trying to set a non existent UCI option gives an error. 
	
  * PG will now resign in case of an illegal engine move. 
	
  * More code has been moved into the I/O abstraction layer pipex. This has reduced to win32 dependence of utils.c
	
  * info strings and unrecognized info lines are relayed to the GUI.

 -- Michel Van den Bergh <michel.vandenbergh@uhasselt.be>  Thu, 6 Aug 2009 20:00:00 +0100

polyglot (1.4.33b) unstable; urgency=low

  * New option: "WbWorkArounds". Currently it blocks options which contain "Draw" in their name from being sent to the GUI. Engines that have such options are Rybka and HIARCS. 
	
  * Bugfix for ASSERT failure in bright. Now another ASSERT failure has appeared which seems to be bright's fault however.

polyglot (1.4.30b) unstable; urgency=low

  * Some more meaningful error messages added.
  * Some buffer overflow checks added.	
  * Simplification of strange signal kludge in gui.c. 
  * Removal of obsolete code in engine.c and gui.c. Platform specific code has been abstracted and pushed into pipex_win32.c and pipex_posix.c
  * The format of the version number has changed once again. Debian was unhappy with the previous one.
	
 -- Michel Van den Bergh <michel.vandenbergh@uhasselt.be>  Sun, 2 Aug 2009 16:00:00 +0100

polyglot (1.4b29) unstable; urgency=low

  * Conversion from C++ to C (suggested by E.M.).
	
  * More refactoring. The win32 and posix I/O have now a uniform interface (see pipex.h).

polyglot (1.4b27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Option "ScoreWhite" : report score from white's point of view (suggested by E.M.).
	
  * Option "KibitzInterval" : try to wait this many seconds between kibitzes (suggested by E.M.).

polyglot (1.4b26) unstable; urgency=low

  * Contraction of version number.
	
  * Log if SetProcessAffinityMask is not available (suggested by E.M.).
	
  * pipe.cpp : Make PipeStruct a proper class with private/public members.
	
  * Check for EOF in GUI input.
	
  * pipe.cpp : delay reporting EOF until buffer is empty.
	
  * Messages from the Engine to PG were not logged in the windows version.

  * The main loop (previously in adapter.cpp) is now in its own file mainloop.cpp.
	
  * adapter.cpp has been renamed into xboard2uci.cpp. It is #ifdef _WIN32 free.
	
  * EOF from the engine no longer kills PG. It should now be possible to close an engine and reopen another one (if that ever were useful)
