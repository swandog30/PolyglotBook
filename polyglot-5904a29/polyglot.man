.Sh "PolyGlot as adapter and book engine"
.IX Subsection "PolyGlot as adapter and book engine"
PolyGlot is a \*(L"\s-1UCI\s0 adapter\*(R".  It connects a \s-1GUI\s0 interface (such as
XBoard, Winboard, Arena or Chessbase) to a \s-1UCI\s0 chess engine.
.PP
By specifying an opening book (in PolyGlot book format) chess engines can
transparently use such books.
.PP
PolyGlot understands the two main \s-1GUI\s0 protocols: \s-1UCI\s0 and
xboard. Normally the protocol will be auto detected but this can be
overridden in the configuration file.
.PP
In xboard mode PolyGlot fully translates between the xboard and \s-1UCI\s0 protocols.
In addition it tries to solve known problems with other adapters.
For instance, it detects and reports draws by fifty-move rule,
repetition, etc ... It also supports Chess960.
.PP
When in \s-1UCI\s0 mode PolyGlot mostly passes commands from the \s-1GUI\s0
to the engine and vice versa, except that it will play book moves on
behalf of the engine when the occasion arises.
.PP
The engine options are exported as \s-1UCI\s0 options in \s-1UCI\s0
mode and as \*(L"feature option=\*(R" commands in xboard mode. The latter form
an extension of the xboard protocol as defined by H.G. Muller.
.PP
Options which normally appear in the [PolyGlot] section of the
config file (see below) are exported as options with their name prefixed
by \*(L"Polyglot\*(R". This makes it easy to filter them in the \s-1GUI\s0.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 Not all options are exported, only those that make sense in the
given mode.
.Sh "Book making utilities"
.IX Subsection "Book making utilities"
PolyGlot supports the \*(L"PolyGlot opening book format\*(R". This is the
defacto standard non-proprietary opening book format. It is fully documented
here
.PP
http://alpha.uhasselt.be/Research/Algebra/Toga/book_format.html
.PP
Roughly speaking a PolyGlot opening book is a collection of triples
(position, move, weight). A \*(L"position\*(R" is represented by a 64\-bit
Zobrist hash key. The weight is proportional to the probability the move should
be played.
.PP
Other opening book formats such as ChessBase's .ctg format and Arena's
\&.abk format are undocumented and proprietary. They can only be used 
by their own GUIs.
.PP
PolyGlot can compile a pgn file into a binary PolyGlot book and furthermore
it can merge two such binary books into a third one.
.PP
PolyGlot can also extract some useful information from PolyGlot books. The utility
\&\*(L"dump-book\*(R" dumps the \*(L"lines\*(R" in a book for a given color. By definition
a line is a sequence of moves (from the starting position) in which
the given color makes only book moves and the other color makes 
arbitrary moves (i.e. not necessarily book moves).
.PP
Since a PolyGlot book is built up from positions and not lines there
may be (and there usually are) many positions in the book that are not
on a \*(L"line\*(R" as defined in the previous paragraph. It is convenient
to call such positions \*(L"isolated\*(R" positions. The utility \*(L"info-book\*(R"
counts such isolated positions.
.PP
Some of the isolated positions are provably unreachable and they
could in principle be deleted from the book. For example if a book
contains only the move \*(L"e4\*(R" in the starting position but also the
position after \*(L"d4 d5\*(R" then this last position is provably unreachable
since it requires white to make a non-book move when a book move is
available. Such situations arise frequently from the priority rules
in merging books.
.PP
Unfortunately not all isolated positions are provably unreachable and
it is difficult to identify the latter. If invoked with \*(L"\-exact\*(R" the
utility info-book will attempt to count the isolated positions which
require a player to make a non-book move when a book move is available.
Due to the possibility of transpositions this is not a fool proof method.
.Sh "Epd test mode"
.IX Subsection "Epd test mode"
In epd test mode, PolyGlot will search positions in an epd file and
record the number of times the right best move was found.  The
arguments specify when to stop the search in any given position.
.Sh "Perft counts"
.IX Subsection "Perft counts"
A perft count is the number of legal move sequence in a given position
up to a given depth. PolyGlot can perform such perft counts. It
is however much slower than other more dedicated programs.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
When PolyGlot is invoked as an adapter of in epd-test mode it gets its
options from a config file and then from the command line.  The
default config file is \*(L"polyglot.ini\*(R" but an alternative one may be
optionally included as first argument. The config file format is
described below.

.el .IP "\fBEngineDir\fR (default: ``.'')" 4
.IX Item "EngineDir (default: .)"
Full path of the directory where the engine is installed.  You can use
\&\*(L".\*(R" (without the quotes) if you know that PolyGlot will be launched in
the engine directory or the engine is in the \*(L"path\*(R" and does not need
any data file.
.IP "\fBEngineCommand\fR" 4
.IX Item "EngineCommand"
Put here the name of the engine executable file.  You can also add
command-line arguments.  Path searching is used and the current
directory will be \*(L"EngineDir\*(R". On Linux the EngineCommand is passed
to wordexp so that shell quoting rules and expansions are applied.
On Windows the EngineCommand is simply passed to CreateProcess which
does its own shell like processing.
.ie n .IP "\fBSettingsDir\fR (default: $HOME/.polyglot on Linux; "".\e_PG"" on Windows)" 4

\&\-noini. Such ini files may be created by pushing the \*(L"Save\*(R" button in the
Engine settings dialog in \s-1WB/XB\s0 4.4.0 and higher. As a special exception
(for \s-1WB/XB\s0 4.4.0 compatibility) this directory is also used in case
PolyGlot is started with config files named \*(L"polyglot_1st.ini\*(R" or
\&\*(L"polyglot_2nd.ini\*(R".
.IP "\fBLog\fR (default: false)" 4

the engine.  This should be necessary only to locate problems.
.IP "\fBLogFile\fR (default: polyglot.log)" 4
.IX Item "LogFile (default: polyglot.log)"
The name of the log file.  Note that it is put where PolyGlot was
launched from, not into the engine directory.
.Sp
\&\s-1WARNING:\s0 Log files are not cleared between sessions, and can become
very large.  It is safe to remove them though.
.IP "\fBResign\fR (default: false)" 4

Set this to \*(L"true\*(R" if you want PolyGlot to resign on behalf of the
engine.
.Sp
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 Some engines display buggy scores from time to time although the
best move is correct.  Use this option only if you know what you are
doing (e.g. you always check the final position of games).

Whether to kibitz when the \s-1PV\s0 is changed (new iteration or new best move).
.ie n .IP "\fBKibitzCommand\fR (default: ""tellall"")" 4
.el .IP "\fBKibitzCommand\fR (default: ``tellall'')" 4
.IX Item "KibitzCommand (default: tellall)"
xboard command to use for kibitzing, normally \*(L"tellall\*(R" for kibitzing
or \*(L"tellothers\*(R" for whispering.
.IP "\fBKibitzDelay\fR (default: 5)" 4
.IX Item "KibitzDelay (default: 5)"
How many seconds to wait before starting kibitzing.  This has an

PolyGlot is unaware of whether the engine is itself using a book or
not.
.IP "\fBBookFile\fR (default: book.bin)" 4
.IX Item "BookFile (default: book.bin)"
The name of the (binary) book file.  Note that PolyGlot will look for

.IX Item "BookLearn (default: false)"
This is a noop.
.IP "\fBBookDepth\fR (default: 256)" 4
.IX Item "BookDepth (default: 256)"
Stop using the book after this number of moves.
.IP "\fBBookTreshold\fR (default: 5)" 4
.IX Item "BookTreshold (default: 5)"
Do not play moves with a weight (probability) lower than this (in per mil).
.IP "\fBUseNice\fR (default: false)" 4
.IX Item "UseNice (default: false)"
Run the engine at nice level 5, or \*(L"NiceValue\*(R" if it set.  On some
operating systems it may be necessary to run the engine at lower
priority for it to be responsive to commands from PolyGlot while
searching.
.IP "\fBNiceValue\fR (default: 5)" 4
.IX Item "NiceValue (default: 5)"
Nice levels go from \-20 to 20 with 20 being the lowest priority.
On Unix only root can set negative nice levels. On Windows the standard
Win32 priority levels are mapped in a sensible way to Unix nice levels.
.IP "\fBAffinity\fR (default: \-1)" 4
.IX Item "Affinity (default: -1)"
This a bit vector in which each bit represents the processors that a
process is allowed to run on. This option works only on Windows.
.IP "\fBSTFudge\fR (default: 20)" 4
.IX Item "STFudge (default: 20)"
PolyGlot will translate \*(L"st x\*(R" as \*(L"go movetime 1000*x\-STFudge\*(R". 
The rationale is that in the \s-1UCI\s0 specification the argument of movetime
is defined as the exact search time whereas the argument of the
st command is only an upperbound.
.IP "\fBOnlyWbOptions\fR (default: true)" 4
.IX Item "OnlyWbOptions (default: true)"
If true then PolyGlot restricts the options it sends to those that
are potentially useful for WinBoard.
.Sh "Work arounds"
.IX Subsection "Work arounds"
Work arounds are identical to options except that they should be used
only when necessary.  Their purpose is to try to hide problems with
various software (not just engines).
.PP
\&\s-1IMPORTANT:\s0 Any of these work arounds might be removed in future
versions of PolyGlot.  You are strongly recommended to contact the
author of faulty software and truly fix the problem.
.PP
PolyGlot supports the following work arounds:
.IP "\fBUCIVersion\fR (default: 2)" 4
.IX Item "UCIVersion (default: 2)"
The default value of 2 corresponds to \s-1UCI+\s0.  Use 1 to select plain
\&\s-1UCI\s0 for engines that have problems with \s-1UCI+\s0.
.IP "\fBCanPonder\fR (default: false)" 4
.IX Item "CanPonder (default: false)"
PolyGlot now conforms to the documented \s-1UCI\s0 behaviour: the engine will
be allowed to ponder only if it (the engine) declares the \*(L"Ponder\*(R" \s-1UCI\s0
option.  However some engines which can actually ponder do not declare
the option.  This work around lets PolyGlot know that they can ponder.
.IP "\fBSyncStop\fR (default: false)" 4
.IX Item "SyncStop (default: false)"
When a ponder miss occurs, Polyglot interrupts the engine and
\&\s-1IMMEDIATELY\s0 launches a new search.  While there should be no problem
with this, some engines seem confused and corrupt their search board.
\&\*(L"SyncStop\*(R" forces PolyGlot to wait for the (now useless) ponder search
to finish before launching the new search.
.IP "\fBPromoteWorkAround\fR (default: false)" 4
.IX Item "PromoteWorkAround (default: false)"
Some engines do not specify a promotion piece, e.g. they send \*(L"e7e8\*(R"
instead of the correct \*(L"e7e8q\*(R".  This work around enables the
incorrect form (and of course promotes into a queen).
.IP "\fBRepeatPV\fR (default: true)" 4
.IX Item "RepeatPV (default: true)"
When true, PolyGlot repeats the last pv string (which also contains
score,depth and time usage) it got from the engine. Some engines
however do not send a new pv string just before sending the move.
In that case the output of PolyGlot would be inconsistent. 
When RepeatPV is false PolyGlot does not repeat the last pv string.
Due to the way kibitzing is implemented, KibitzMove is disabled in that case.
.Sh "[Engine] section"
.IX Subsection "[Engine] section"
This section contains engine \s-1UCI\s0 options.  PolyGlot does not
understand them, but sends the information to the engine at startup
(converted to \s-1UCI\s0 form).  You can add any \s-1UCI\s0 option that makes sense
to the engine (not just the common options about hash-table size and
tablebases).
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 use \s-1INI\s0 syntax, not \s-1UCI\s0.  For example \*(L"OwnBook = true\*(R" is
correct.  It will be replaced by PolyGlot with \*(L"setoption name OwnBook
value true\*(R" at engine startup.
.PP
Standard \s-1UCI\s0 options are
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    Hash 
\&    NalimovPath
\&    NalimovCache
\&    OwnBook
.Ve
.PP
Hidden options like \*(L"Ponder\*(R" or \*(L"UCI_xxx\*(R" are automatic
and should not be put in an \s-1INI\s0 file.
.PP
The other options are engine-specific.  Check their name using a \s-1UCI\s0
\&\s-1GUI\s0 or launch the engine in a console and type \*(L"uci\*(R".
